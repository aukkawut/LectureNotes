# Course Notes Repository

This repository contains my lecture notes from various courses I've taken. Each folder corresponds to a specific course (denoted by course code and title).

## Disclaimer
These notes are from lectures I attended. While I wrote these notes based on my understanding and interpretation of the lectures, the content and structure heavily draw from the course material. They represent my attempt to explain and organize the concepts presented in class, but the underlying ideas and approaches come from the lectures. As these are personal notes, they may contain errors or misunderstandings.
